## What does the program do?
This project uses OOP to create an inventory manager that can perform various functions such as allowing users to view all items in the inventory, display the total value of each item in the inventory. Search and find a product using the product code, add a product to the inventory, identify the lowest stocked item and provide the option to restock, identify the highest stocked item and put the item on sale.  
## How to get started.
You need all two files for the program to run successfully. Ensure you copy the txt file into the appopriate directory so your compiler can read from it. 
## Final notes.
I will be adding a GUI to the program in the next update. Stay tuned...
